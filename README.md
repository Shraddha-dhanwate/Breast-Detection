# Breast Cancer Detection

This project focuses on breast cancer detection using machine learning. The goal is to develop a model that can classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on given features.

## Dataset
- **File Name:** `Breast-detection.csv`
- The dataset contains various features related to breast tumor characteristics, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness.
- The target variable indicates whether the tumor is **benign (non-cancerous)** or **malignant (cancerous)**.

## Model Implementation
- The project uses **machine learning algorithms** such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Deep Learning (if applicable)
- The dataset is preprocessed using techniques like:
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature scaling
  - Splitting into training and testing sets
- Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- The trained model predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on input features.
- Evaluation metrics are analyzed to determine model effectiveness.

## Internship & Guidance

This project was suggested and guided by InternPe as part of their Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning internship program. Their mentorship helped in selecting the dataset, structuring the model, and improving performance evaluation.
